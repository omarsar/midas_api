My Friend, My FriendFor M. W. K., who hesitates each time she sees a young girl wearing The CrossWho will forgive me for the things I do?With no special legend or God to refer to,With my calm white pedigree, my yankee kin,I think it would be better to be a Jew.I forgive you for what you did not do,I am impossibly guilty. Unlike you,My friend, I can not blame my originWith no special legend or God to refer to.They wear The Crucifix as they are meant to do.Why do their little crosses trouble you?The effigies that I have made are genuine(I think it would be better to be a Jew).Watching my mother slowly die I knewMy first release. I wish some ancient bugabooFollowed me. But my sin is always my sin.With no special legend or God to refer to.Who will forgive me for the things I do?To have your reasonable hurt to belong toMight ease my trouble like liquor or aspirin.I think it would be better to be a Jew.And if I lie, I lie because I love you,Because I am bothered by the things I do,Because your hurt invades my calm white skin:With no special legend or God to refer to,I think it would be better to be a Jew.
