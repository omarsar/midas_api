Female AuthorAll day she plays at chess with the bones of the wonFavored (while suddenly the rains beginBeyond the window) she lies on cushions curledAnd nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin.Prim, pink-breasted, feminine, she nursesChocolate fancies in rose-papered roomsWhere polished highboys whisper creaking cursesAnd hothouse roses shed immoral blooms.The garnets on her fingers twinkle quickAnd blood reflects across the manuscript;She muses on the odor, sweet and sick,Of festering gardenias in a crypt,And lost in subtle metaphor, retreats From gray child faces crying in the streets.
